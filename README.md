# Course Recommendation using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Introduction
This project aims to recommend courses based on reviews of previous course takers by classifying positive, neutral and negative sentiments using a fine-tuned LLM for sentiment classification. The project compares the performance of LLMs like BERT and RoBERTa and their different encoder size variations to find the best performing one.
